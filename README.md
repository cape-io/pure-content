# pure-content
A place to keep track of some "pure content" ideas/ideals 

## What is "PureContent?"

*PureContent* is a philosophy, not a format. (Though certain formats must be avoided.)

Pure Content:
- Favors the creator
- Is creatable/editable with many tools
- Is future-friendly
- DRY (does not repeat itself)
- Migratable/translatable across tools, platforms and formats
- Contains structure not style (WYSIWYM not WYSIWYG)

Content display by Template: A single content source with continuous possibilities for display.
